This project is a Streamlit-based interactive tax bracket explorer. Prioritize code that is modular, interactive, and visually clear. Use Streamlit widgets for interactivity and Plotly for pie charts. Include support for historical and custom tax brackets, side-by-side comparisons, and export/share features.
